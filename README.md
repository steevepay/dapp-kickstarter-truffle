# DAPP Kickstater

## Setup

at the root directory, you have to create a '.env' file with your Ethereum [INFURA API](https://infura.io/) url:

```js
INFURA_URL = "https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/...";
// You can also use this link: https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/aa7a461490244b65a54e2f67b959fa8a
```

Create a '.secret' file containing your ethereum wallet mnemonic (12 words, from metamask):

```
pistol cat dog etc...
```

Install the dependency:

```shell
$ npm install
```

You need Truffle installed:

```shell
$ npm install -g truffle@5.0.21
```

Then compile the contracts:

```shell
$ truffle compile
```

Then deploy you contract on the ethereum test network of your choice (configs on the 'truffle-config.js'):

```shell
$ truffle migrate --network=rinkeby
```

Finallyse your '.env' file by adding your deployed contract address:

```js
FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x8...";
// or you can use the following deployed contract: 0xB005bCAfb16751Ad408d7C4bBe3A15349c0E2Bec
```

Runs the app:

```
npm run start
```
